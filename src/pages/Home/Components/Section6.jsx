                Kid Rock’s career has been built on authenticity.
                He stands by: <br /> <br />

                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom of speech</li>
                    <li>Love of country</li>
                    <li>Respect for hard work</li>
                    <li>Deep loyalty to friends and fans</li>
                </ul>

                <br />

                He’s outspoken. He’s fearless. And even when it’s controversial, he refuses to be anything other than himself.

                In his own words:
                <i>“I’d rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I’m not.”</i>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
